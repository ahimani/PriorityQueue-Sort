# PriorityQueue-Sort

This project aims at implementing Selection Sort as a priority queue based on an unordered vector, Insertion Sort as a priority queue based on an ordered vector and Heap Sort based on a minheap.

It compares the number of comparisons done by these three algorithms with STL C++ Sort function to analyze their running times and efficiency.
